# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Ð¡alculator constructor

The right side of the screen is the canvas. You can throw components on it from the left side. In constructor mode, you can assemble the interface, but when you click on the buttons, they do nothing. In runtime mode, you can't drag anything, but the calculator works.

## Stack & Technologies: 

React, TypeScript, SCSS, Redux.
